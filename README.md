# Dentist
 
In this project I recreated a dentist's website fully responsive, some elements are worth looking at, even the project is not ready though.

At first, we have our minimalistic header with a few elements such as "Who am I", "Quotes", "About" and "Contact" and underneath it, a dinamic gallery that will be developed with VanillaJS e CSS.

Next we have three lorem ipsum div's that when responsive it changes the flex-direction from 'row' to 'column'.

There are a gallery with a few embed videos from youtube, a section of mouth diseases e it's treatment, pacients' quotes and instagram gallery (photos will be added soon).

At last we have our form section and our footer with address, contact and schedule;
